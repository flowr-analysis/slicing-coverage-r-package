Description: Track and report code coverage for your package. Compared to
    traditional approaches, Slicing Coverage aims to enhance the accuracy
    of coverage scores by calculating them based on the program slice
    resulting from the testâ€™s assertion criteria. This way, we are able to
    account for code that's covered but no checked, thus providing a score
    that can reflect the tests quality more accurately. This package
    integrates with most of covr's functionality and should therefore be
    easily integrated into existing projects.
